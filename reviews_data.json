My kids, who are notoriously picky about pizza, loved it. My husband raved about the golden wings and is already asking when we can go back for more. The prices were incredibly reasonable—I honestly couldn’t make the food for less at home!\n\nWhat really sets this place apart, though, is the service. The staff are so friendly and helpful. It’s easy to see why people love this spot—we certainly do! We’ll definitely be regulars. Thank you so much for such a fantastic experience!"

I’m new to the whole gluten free thing. Pizza is one of my favourite order out meals, so I was worried that it would be hard to find a good gluten free one. But Johnny’s gluten free crust was great!! It’s thin, but very crispy and delicious! Definitely recommend to all the gluten free peeps out there!"

The meat was juicy and tender. I'll definitely be back. The only suggestion I can make is: have you ever considered selling individual cups of home-made dipping sauces?

After years of pizza tasting, it has all come down to the best looking pizza deliverer. The most beautiful and attractive pizza deliverer Yuvraj has changed the entire pizza game. Although I haven't had a taste of this pizza. I can assure you it is 5 stars due to the fact that the delivery man, Yuvraj was just so irresistibly cute."

To me it's a perfect place for a quick lunch stop!\n2 of us had a couple pieces of pizza, and an ice tea and it wasn't 11 bucks!\nNot much for decor but I think it's a great place to have a quick pizza as it's usually ready when you walk in.\nAlthough it's not a restaurant per se. I think he deserves a bit better than 4 stars for what he does and the niche her is in."

The people who deliver the pizza are also so kind and great to my kids. What stands out is definitely the service. I ordered pizza one day as I was sick and the delivery guy was a young man who knew I was sick and ordered pizza for my kids so I could rest. While I was paying he grabbed my shovel and shovel my steps and sidewalk for me as it had snowed the day before and I was physically unable to shovel. Great ppl and great pizza."
