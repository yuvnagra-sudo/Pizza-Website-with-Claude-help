## Idea 1: Bold Value Brutalism

**Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism meets Direct Response Marketing

**Core Principles**:
- Aggressive use of brand colors (royal blue #1E22AA, electric yellow #FFC627) in high-contrast blocks
- Oversized typography that commands attention
- Stark, unapologetic layouts with zero decorative elements
- Every pixel serves the conversion goal

**Color Philosophy**: The logo's blue and yellow aren't just colors—they're weapons. Deep royal blue creates authority and trust (like a handshake that means business), while electric yellow screams value and grabs eyeballs. No gradients, no softening—pure, saturated blocks that punch through the noise. White text on blue for credibility, black text on yellow for urgency.

**Layout Paradigm**: Asymmetric power blocks. Large yellow banners slice diagonally across blue sections. The "2 for 1" offer dominates the hero in a massive yellow rectangle that takes up 60% of the viewport. Content flows in chunky, offset containers—nothing centered, everything intentional. Mobile-first with thumb-zone CTAs.

**Signature Elements**:
- Thick 8px borders in contrasting colors around all CTAs and cards
- Oversized price tags in yellow circles with blue borders
- Hard drop shadows (16px offset, no blur) creating depth through layering
- Phone number in a fixed yellow bar at screen bottom on mobile

**Interaction Philosophy**: Immediate feedback. Buttons grow 5% on hover with a sharp snap. Clicks trigger a brief yellow flash. No smooth easing—everything is instant, decisive, like making a phone call. Scroll-triggered animations are abrupt reveals, not gentle fades.

**Animation**: Sharp, snappy micro-interactions. 150ms duration max. Buttons scale up with cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.27, 1.55) for a punchy overshoot. Section reveals use hard cuts with stagger delays. No parallax, no smooth scrolling—just crisp, attention-grabbing movements.

**Typography System**:
- Headings: **Bebas Neue** (all caps, 900 weight) - matches the bold, condensed style of the logo
- Subheadings: **Bebas Neue** (700 weight, slightly smaller)
- Body: **Inter** (500 weight for readability, 400 for secondary text)
- Prices: **Bebas Neue** (900 weight, oversized)
- The logo uses a custom bold condensed sans—Bebas Neue is the closest web-safe match

## Idea 2: Retro Americana Diner

**Design Movement**: 1950s Americana with Modern Clarity

**Core Principles**:
- Nostalgic warmth through vintage diner aesthetics
- Playful use of blue and yellow as classic diner colors
- Rounded, friendly shapes that invite comfort
- Value-forward messaging wrapped in familiarity

**Color Philosophy**: The blue and yellow evoke classic American diners and roadside pizza joints—think neon signs and vinyl booths. Royal blue (#2B2D7E) becomes the "night sky" backdrop, while golden yellow (#FFD700) is the "warm light" that draws you in. Add cream (#FFF8DC) for vintage menu boards and red (#DC143C) accents for "hot deals." The palette says: trusted, local, been here forever.

**Layout Paradigm**: Horizontal banded sections with full-width colored stripes, like a diner's exterior. Hero section features a large circular "plate" design with the main offer in the center. Menu sections use card layouts that mimic vintage menu boards. Generous padding creates a spacious, comfortable feel. Navigation is a classic horizontal bar with rounded pill buttons.

**Signature Elements**:
- Rounded corners (16px radius) on all containers and buttons
- Vintage-style "starburst" badges for deals (yellow with blue text)
- Dotted lines separating menu items (like classic diner menus)
- Circular photo frames for food images with thick blue borders

**Interaction Philosophy**: Friendly and inviting. Hover states gently lift elements with a soft shadow. Clicks produce a subtle "ding" effect (visual bounce). The experience feels like flipping through a well-loved menu—familiar, comfortable, trustworthy.

**Animation**: Gentle, welcoming movements. Elements fade in with 400ms ease-in-out. Buttons have a soft 3px lift on hover. Scroll reveals use a gentle slide-up with 600ms duration. Starburst badges rotate slowly (20s full rotation) to catch the eye without being distracting.

**Typography System**:
- Headings: **Alfa Slab One** (bold, rounded slab serif for that vintage sign feel)
- Subheadings: **Bebas Neue** (matches logo, provides hierarchy)
- Body: **Roboto** (clean, readable, slightly rounded terminals)
- Prices: **Alfa Slab One** (big, bold, unmissable)
- The rounded, bold aesthetic complements the logo's friendly oval shape

## Idea 3: High-Contrast Minimalist Grid

**Design Movement**: Swiss Modernism meets Mobile-First Design

**Core Principles**:
- Extreme clarity through whitespace and grid discipline
- Blue and yellow as functional color codes, not decoration
- Information hierarchy through scale and weight alone
- Every element aligned to an 8px grid system

**Color Philosophy**: Blue and yellow become functional signals, not emotional triggers. Royal blue (#1E22AA) = primary actions and trust anchors. Yellow (#FFC627) = urgency and value indicators. White (#FFFFFF) = breathing room and clarity. Black (#000000) = information. The palette is a system: blue says "this is important," yellow says "act now," white says "rest your eyes."

**Layout Paradigm**: Strict 12-column grid with mathematical precision. Asymmetric layouts where content occupies 7 columns, whitespace takes 5. Hero section uses a split-screen: left side is pure blue with white text, right side is a full-bleed food photo. All elements snap to the grid. Mobile collapses to a single column with maintained proportions.

**Signature Elements**:
- Ultra-thin 1px divider lines in light gray (#E5E5E5)
- Floating cards with 2px solid blue borders (no shadows)
- Yellow highlight bars (8px tall) above section headings
- Monospaced numbers for prices creating visual rhythm

**Interaction Philosophy**: Purposeful and precise. Every interaction has a clear outcome. Hover states change only the border color (blue to yellow). Clicks provide instant visual confirmation through color inversion. No decorative animations—only functional state changes.

**Animation**: Minimal and purposeful. Transitions are 200ms linear—no easing curves. Elements either exist or they don't—no fading. Page sections load instantly with no scroll effects. The only animation is a yellow progress bar (2px) that tracks scroll position at the top of the viewport.

**Typography System**:
- Headings: **Oswald** (700 weight, tight letter-spacing) - geometric and bold like the logo
- Subheadings: **Oswald** (500 weight)
- Body: **Inter** (400 weight, 1.6 line-height for maximum readability)
- Prices: **Space Mono** (monospaced, 700 weight) - creates visual rhythm and emphasis
- The geometric precision of Oswald mirrors the logo's structured letterforms

## Selected Approach: Bold Value Brutalism

This approach best aligns with the Alex Hormozi direct-response philosophy and the bold, confident brand identity of Johnny's Pizza & Wings. The aggressive use of brand colors, oversized typography, and conversion-focused layout will cut through the noise in the competitive Airdrie pizza market. The design says: "We're confident in our value, and we're not afraid to show it."
